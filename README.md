## Purpose

The goal of this application is to empower users by reducing their reliance on large corporations, such as Google, for traffic data. Trafficy aims to provide users with real-time information on traffic accidents in their area, enabling them to avoid disruptions on their usual routes. The core idea is that while drivers are familiar with their routes, they are often unaware of traffic incidents that may have occurred, affecting their commute. By providing an at a glance view of nearby traffic incidents, the app helps users reach their destinations more efficiently.

We will gather traffic data from a company called TomTom API. However, if the accuracy of the traffic data is ever called into question by a significant number of users, they will have the ability to report inaccuracies. Should enough reports accumulate, the developers will switch to a different data provider.

## Commitment to User Privacy

Trafficy is a free service and will remain free indefinitely. We are committed to protecting user privacy and will not collect any unnecessary personal information. Only essential login details will be stored, and sensitive information such as user addresses will be handled on the frontend (directly on the user's device). This information will only be used when the user specifically requests traffic data.

We will not store sensitive personal information, such as user addresses, on our backend systems. All traffic-related data will be used solely for the purpose of providing traffic insights and improving user experience.
